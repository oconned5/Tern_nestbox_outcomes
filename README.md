# Tern_nestbox_outcomes

Analyses of 15 years of Roseate Tern nest outcomes, assessing the effects of next box use on the lay date, number of eggs laid, proportion of eggs which hatch and proportion of nestlings which go on to fledge. These analyses provide a data driven assessment of the effectiveness of tern nest boxes as a conservation intervention.
Additionally, the relationship between natural cover and number of eggs laid, proportion of eggs which hatch and proportion of nestlings which go on to fledge for nests laid outside of nest boxes in 2016.

Conservation of breeding Roseate, Common and Arctic Terns on Rockabill Island has been carried out by BirdWatch Ireland, under contract to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.
